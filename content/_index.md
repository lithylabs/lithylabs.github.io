title: "LithyLabs"
---

LithyLabs is a personal lab created by Jeffrey Kleiss to explore ideas at the intersection of design, software architecture, and artificial intelligence. It’s a place to experiment, prototype, and pressure-test concepts—from system design patterns to AI-driven solutions—without the constraints of production deadlines. LithyLabs exists to learn in public, refine craft, and turn curiosity into practical, well-reasoned solutions.
