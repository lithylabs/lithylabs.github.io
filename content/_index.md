# Welcome to LithyLabs

**LithyLabs** is a personal lab created by Jeffrey Kleiss to share the projects,
experiments, and ideas he’s developed throughout his career. Some projects are
recreations or evolutions of past work, rebuilt with fresh perspective. Others
are active learning projects—works in progress meant to explore new
technologies, patterns, and ways of thinking.

LithyLabs emerged after the Lithy startup was shut down, becoming a place to
reflect, rebuild, and continue creating without the constraints of a single
product or company. The full background and motivation behind that transition is
shared in the [Our Story post](/posts/our_story).

At its core, LithyLabs focuses on frameworks and AI integrations. Many of the
framework projects challenge existing conventions, proposing alternative
approaches to architecture, testing, and system design. The AI work documents
Jeffrey’s hands-on journey through traditional deep learning as well as modern
generative AI—sharing both practical implementations and the lessons learned
along the way.
