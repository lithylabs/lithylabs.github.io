# LithyLabs: Our Story

LithyLabs grew out of a startup called **Lithy**, which aimed to merge AI
technologies with bookmarking tools. The vision was simple but ambitious: a tool
that could analyze your browsing habits and automatically remember and
prioritize the websites that mattered most to you.

Lithy showed real promise, providing smart search and organization for the pages
you cared about. Ultimately, however, two factors led to its closure: privacy
concerns and the rapid rise of generative AI for search and learning—the latter
being the primary reason for shutting down.

Throughout Lithy’s development, we relied heavily on generative AI to accelerate
learning and development. We realized that the traditional ways of finding
answers—through Google or StackOverflow—were no longer the most effective. Lithy
was designed to make that process faster, smarter, and shareable. Rather than
fight the changing landscape, we decided to evolve, and **LithyLabs was born**.

LithyLabs is our new platform for exploring what AI can do for startups and
innovation. We focus on how AI will transform the way we learn, work, and
create. It’s a place to share insights, experiments, and ideas.

Thanks for visiting—stay tuned for what’s next!
